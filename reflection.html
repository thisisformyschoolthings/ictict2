<p align="center">I think ICT is a fun subject. It tests our thinking skills by challenging us to replicate or to create using our little knowledge, to create something meaningful. I really appreciate the teacher aswell, I notice her struggles and how she works hard for everyone, not just her students. She shows a good passion in ICT and really motivates a lot of students, like myself, to continue learning with enthusiasm. I think ICT will really be important to me in my future, as I want to be a computer engineer when I grow up. ICT is the stepping stone to my possible future career and life. Thank you, Miss Uminga.
